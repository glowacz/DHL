A platform for a courier company.
The company has two types of employees:
* Office Worker, who can accept or reject orders that came from an outside source
* Courier, who can take, pickup, deliver (or not) the orders; when they deliver or cannot deliver their order, an email is sent to the customer

The employee must log in with Google to be able to perform their actions.

Run instructions:

***npm run dev*** for client (run this when in client folder)

run the server (***dotnet watch*** or via IDE)

Now you can access the platform on localhost:3001
